### Install & Run

 1. Check your Node.js version is 5+.
 2. `npm install`
 2. Run server with `npm start`.
 3. Go to http://localhost:3000/.

*PS*: Do not forget to also run mongodb (sometimes with `mongod`)

## What is currently working?
 - All pages are working: you can sign-up, sign-in, create/edit/access/answer polls and reading polls stats.
 - Website design part could be improved, but we still think it is user-friendly enough to be used without big issues.
 - We can't delete a poll yet.

## Dev

 - `gulp.setup` copy angular2 javascript bundle to the public folder
 - `gulp ts` for the Angular part, compile typescript files to javascript
 - `gulp watch.ts` for the Angular part, watch typescript files and compile to javascript
 - `gulp sass` for the SASS part, compile sass files to css
 - `gulp watch.sass` for the SASS part, watch sass files and compile to css
 - `gulp watch` watch both Angular and SASS part
 - `gulp` alias to setup and then watch both Angular and SASS part

You can also watch both if you simply run `gulp`.

### Watch Sass and TypeScript

 - First install **gulp** if you want to watch and automatically update Sass and TypeScript project's files.
 - Run the `gulp` command into the root directory of the project.

### Add a new view

If you want to add a new view to the project, there are several steps. You have to know that views are grouped by components.
- First of all, create your new Jade view in the "*/server/view/components/*" directory.
- Once done, create a new folder containing the TypeScript file related to your new view in the "*/client/components/*" directory. In this file, you'll have to set the view's selector and template's URL (indicating where in the Jade file), write a directive for the application's router and export the view's class. You can help yourself by building the file on what already exists.
- Then, register your new view in the application's bootstrap file ("*/client/bootstrap.ts*") under the **@RouteConfig** annotation. Don't forget to import your new view's class in the header!
- Finally, you also have to link your view with the Express' router, by adding a clause on the "*/server/routes/components.js*" file. You will be able to use it if you want to communicate with the database, for example.

# How we build the app

## Angular2

### Why Angular2?
Even if Angular2 is still in ~Alpha~ Beta release, we wanted to try it because of the modernity it brings with it. In a few years it'll probably be very mainstream and it would be a plus to know it.
Angular2 is not only one of the most current and modern way to design websites but also had many advantages, including:
- The using of web components so you don't have to use the $scope anymore
- ES7's decorators, which simplify notation
- The using of TypeScript language, which is a more modern and complete way to write code
- Performance: Angular got a lot of overlay within years so it became heavy ; Angular2 has been entirely reconsidered and is lighter
- Angular was designed during a time when Smartphones and tablets where rarer than our time; Angular2 is really current
- Within the last years, Angular's developers had a lot of time to think about a more easily and proper way to use it so you can understand everything, including these automagic things happening in the background

### Technologies
We choose to use Angular2 with Typescript. Gulp is used to compile the typescript files to javascript (ES5).

 - Source files are in the `client/` folder
 - tsconfig.json is the configuration file used by *tsc* (typescript compiler) the compile typescript files to `public/javascript/` folder. `emitDecoratorMetadata` and `experimentalDecorators` are ES7 features and need to be activated for Angular2
 - We use *System.js* to load files in different folders. `config.js` is loaded to know how to load javascript files. We can then import files as modules and just load the bootstrap file with `System.import('javascripts/bootstrap.js')`
 - `tsd.json` was generated with `tsd`, it load interfaces for installed modules to add types to javascript code
